cd kv-manager

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Copy environment template
cp .env.example .env

npx wrangler dev --config wrangler.dev.toml --local
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173` with the Worker API at `http://localhost:8787`.

## 📋 Coding Standards

- Avoid `any` types - use proper typing
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase
- Run `npm run lint` before committing

### React Components

- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep components focused and single-purpose
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks
- Use TypeScript interfaces for props

### Styling

- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Follow existing design patterns
- Use shadcn/ui components when available
- Maintain responsive design

### Git Commits

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

## 🧪 Testing

### Local Development Testing

The Worker provides mock data for local testing:

```

Test all major features:
- Namespace listing and creation

If you have a Cloudflare account:

```bash
# Deploy to your account
